# Streetwise scoring

This is a script using a pre-trained neural network (see [1]) to predict the perceived safety score of a certain place in a city.
The NN model compares pairs of images and estimates which one is taken in the safest place. This information is then used to compute the TrueSkill score [2] using the TrueSkill package [3]. The results are then exported in the GeoJSON format [4].

### Results

Sample results can be found in the ```safety_scores``` folder. These can be easily visualized, for example using mapbox:
